2. 11 Hours
3. All three functions should be working and end result match the example output.
4. Pyspark dataframe was different to work with. Lots of small little 
	niche that i'm not familiar with. Thanks to the lab, it wasn't as
	bad.
5. I liked working with databricks, the VM ware and AWS was really difficult
	to work with. I'm sure they're very useful in the real world but setting 
	it up for class environment can get difficult.
	Working on this assignment helped me understand TF-IDF better and I appreciate
	the chance to work with PySpark and RDD. Your class usually does a
	great job at introducing new technologies and letting students apply
	them. :)
